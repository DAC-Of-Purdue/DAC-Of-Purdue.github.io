title: Food Waste Data Tracking
permalink: /food-waste-tracking/
long-description:
    The City of West Lafayette collects food waste to generate electricity, but has limited tracking on donation weights.<BR><BR>
    We are building an IoT system to capture individual donations and visualize the data in a dashboard.
    This project was started at the ASABE AIM Hackathon 2024 and will continue development within the club.
