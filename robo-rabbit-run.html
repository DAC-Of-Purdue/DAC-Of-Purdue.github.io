long-description:
  Our club was one of four recipients of the Boiler Gold Rush Entertainment Challenge grant to create an interactive installation for Fall 2024 orientation. <br><br>
  It was a showdown of robots in a 16'x16' arena, where players aimed to collect carrots as a remote-controlled rabbit without getting caught by our autonomous <a href="/scarecrow-bot/">Scarecrow Bot</a>. <br><br>
  The project was featured in Purdue news. Check  it out <a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/news/2024/08/digital-ag-clubs-scarecrow-bot-making-its-debut-at-boiler-gold-rush.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/studentsuccess/news/11_06_24.html">here</a>.
