long-description:
    Animals like deer and rabbits can be cute, but not when they eat your horticultural crops! <BR><BR>

    We are building a prototype using the <a href="https://www.turtlebot.com/">TurtleBot</a> 
    but our goal for field applications is with <a href="https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga">The Amiga</a>.

    We hope to test this at the Purdue Student Farm.
