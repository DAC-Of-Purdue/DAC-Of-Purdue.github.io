title: Smart Irrigation Decision Support System
permalink: /smart-irrigation/
long-description:
    Farmers want more optimized water use! We are doing just that by analyzing weather and soil sensor data to determine ideal conditions as training data for our model. 
    Then, we use rule-based logic to provide irrigation recommendations, which users receive through an extremely user-friendly dashboard and Chatbot support!<BR><BR>
    This project started at the ASABE AIM Hackathon 2024 and will continue development within the club.
